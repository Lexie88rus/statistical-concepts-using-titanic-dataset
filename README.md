# Demonstration of Statistical Concepts on Titanic Dataset
Jupiter notebook which contains explanation of basic statistical concepts and examples using Titanic dataset

## Description
Knowledge of statistics is essential for data scientists. The following are the examples of applications of statistics for data science:
* Optain the general understanding and description of the data: data types, measurement of general tendency of the data and its dispersion.
* Find out possible outliers in data.
* Find out possible dependencies between different features in dataset.
* Build machine learning models, which use statistical concepts, such as Naive Bayes or Estimation Maximization algorithms.
* Measure statistical significance of the results of the experiments.

In this notebook I demonstrated the application of the most common statistical concepts using the widely known Titanic dataset:
* describe and visualize the data,
* find correlations between variables,
* discover statistical significance.
